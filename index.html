            <p class="paragraph2">I love painting/refinishing old furniture. Itâ€™s very easy to make a piece modern and unique to your style. The following are the steps we take to prep a piece for paint. 

                1	Start with scuff sanding the whole piece with 220 grit or medium sanding block. This will help the paint adhere to the piece.
                2	Fill in gaps or holes as needed with wood filler and sand even once dried. 
                3	Wash the whole piece with Dawn dish soap and warm water or a non toxic cleaner. Vacuum as needed underneath the piece or in the drawer slots.
                4	Fix any necessary issues to ensure itâ€™s working properly again. Such as drawer opens or closes flawlessly.
                5	Prime as needed, especially if the wood looks like it will bleed through the paint color or if the wood is Cherry, Mahogany.
                6	Start painting and have fun! ðŸ¤©
